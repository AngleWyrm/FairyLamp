  <description>Add-on for More Monsters mod

Adds a lantern to the game that is powered by fairy dust

    It's built using 5 metal + 2 fairy dust
    Forest fairies produce enough dust to support up to five lanterns each
    Has a tank that can hold fuel enough for a whole season -- 3 fairy dust
    Costs about 50 silver and 20 seconds in labor
